# Deep Learning Applications Exploration

This repository lists all the documentation of the algorithms and projects I worked on in the AI-related courses I took at Boston University.

* ConvNet and Style transfer

  [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://)

  *   Implemented the Style transfer learning methods to produce excellent results on very small datasets with very little computational time.

  *   Imported the famous VGG19 model and based on specific input data, retune the network structures and parameters for different style results.

* Bias and GANs

  *

* Reinforcement Learning

  *   Cartpole games (Discrete action spaces) with DQN algorithm

  *   Pendulum games (Continuous action spaces) with DDPG algorithm.
