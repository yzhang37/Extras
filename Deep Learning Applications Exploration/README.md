# Deep Learning Applications Exploration

This repository lists all the documentation of the algorithms and projects I worked on in the AI-related courses I took at **Boston University**.

* [**ConvNet and Style transfer**](./CS523_HW3_CNN_n_Style_Transfer.ipynb) [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yzhang37/Extras/blob/main/Deep%20Learning%20Applications%20Exploration/CS523_HW3_CNN_n_Style_Transfer.ipynb)
  *   Implemented the Style transfer learning methods to produce excellent results on very small datasets with little computational time.
  
  * Imported the famous VGG19 model, and basing on specific input data, finetuneed the network structures and parameters for different style results.

* [**Bias and GANs**](./CS523_HW4_Bias_n_GANs.ipynb) [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yzhang37/Extras/blob/main/Deep%20Learning%20Applications%20Exploration/CS523_HW4_Bias_n_GANs.ipynb)
  
  * Implemented the Generator to generate images looks real to fool the discriminator, and the Discriminator, to act as a fact checker to determine which image is fake or real.
  
  * Imported DCGAN model, produce a model to turn characters with any color hairs into realistic black, blonde, or brown hairs.
