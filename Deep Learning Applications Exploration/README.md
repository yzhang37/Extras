# Deep Learning Applications Exploration

This repository lists all the documentation of the algorithms and projects I worked on in the AI-related courses I took at **Boston University**.

* [**ConvNet and Style transfer**](./CS523_HW3_CNN_n_Style_Transfer.ipynb) [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yzhang37/Extras/blob/main/Deep%20Learning%20Applications%20Exploration/CS523_HW3_CNN_n_Style_Transfer.ipynb)
  *   Implemented the Style transfer learning methods to produce excellent results on very small datasets with very little computational time.
  
  *   Imported the famous VGG19 model and based on specific input data, retune the network structures and parameters for different style results.
